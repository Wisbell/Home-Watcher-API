# Home-Watcher-API
Express API for back-end capstone

## Information

This API interfaces with a MongoDB.  The MongoDB stores two collections: Media and Users.  The media collection contains the URL of the image stored on AWS S3(Amazon Web Services: Simple Storage Solutions) and the date the pictures was recorded.  The Users collection stores the user's email in plain text and password in encrypted form.
